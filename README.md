# Finite State Machine Projects
Implementation of the two projects based on the FSM

## Description
### Project "Translations"
This project builds eps-NDFSM (Non-Deterministic Finite State Automaton with eps-links), next it is translated to 
NDFSM (Non-Deterministic Finite State Automaton without eps-links) and next it is translated to 
DFSM (Deterministic Finite State Automaton). 

After each translaton script builds FSM-tree and draw it using the ***GraphViz*** module.

### Requirements for project "Translations"
- Python 3.6+
- Graphviz (with the C++ compilator)

### Project "Code Generation"
This project translates mathematical expressions into code in Assembler language. 
After that script builds operations tree and draw it using the ***GraphViz*** module.

### Requirements for project "Code Generation"
- Python 3.6+
- Graphviz (with the C++ compilator)
- PythonDS
